# Outline for the Kubernetes Release Blog
This outline can be used as reference for writing up the release blog. The following sections should give you an idea what can be consider for the blog, but it's not necessary to include every section. Include the ones that make sense for the features/announcements in the release.

* Introduction to release
    * The first paragraph of the release blog announcement introduces the release, its focus, and its importance.
* Release Highlights (Enhancements)
    * Order release features by impact, maturity, vision.
    * This section lists out the key features (even if they are not being recommended to be used in production or are alphas).
        * When we describe something in the alpha state, we are highlighting what is going on (in/to) the community.
        * Release cycles are so short, just because it is alpha right now, it will be stable soon. Position it as “this is what is coming.”
    * Include additional features and what's next section following the key release features.
        * This is the vision and brand new thing you can do in-production right now.
    * Everything else is included in the release notes.
* Changes in stable, beta, alpha
    * List major changes not covered in themes
    * Call out important API deprecations and removals
    * When possible, link upstream docs or KEP docs (past blogs link k/enhancement issues)

    * Optional section to call out specific known issues and workarounds, if applicable.
* Release notes
    * Release notes are always included in the blog announcement.
* Availability of release
    * Link to where the release can be downloaded on GitHub.
    * Include interactive tutorials on the current release or how to get started with Kubernetes when relevant.
* Release Team
    * Mention job of release team
    * Important to highlight company contributions in a way that is respectful to the entire community – including a copy of the release team in relation to the project and their work
    * Mention efforts of community
    * Mention the growth of the community
    * List of contributors to the spec should go in the 5 Day blog series

    * Number of companies involved in the release
    * Other relevant velocity numbers from DevStats
* Event Updates

## Release Blog Template

The template should give you some boilerplate. However, each release has its own story to tell, there will be always something special around and exactly this flavour must be brought and individualized into the relase blog. Don't be just a copy cat.

### Release Team

<FIND AN INDIVIDUAL TEXT, EACH RELEASE TEAM HAS ITS OWN STORY, TELL IT! BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE FROM PAST RELEASES>

Kubernetes is only possible with the support, commitment, and hard work of its community. 
Each release team is made up of dedicated community volunteers who work together to build the many pieces that make up the Kubernetes releases you rely on. 
This requires the specialized skills of people from all corners of our community, from the code itself to its documentation and project management.

We would like to thank the entire [release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.XX/release-team.md) for the hours spent hard at work to deliver the Kubernetes v1.31 release to our community. 
The Release Team's membership ranges from first-time shadows to returning team leads with experience forged over several release cycles. 
A very special thanks goes out our release lead, RELEASE LEAD, for supporting us through a successful release cycle, advocating for us, making sure that we could all contribute in the best way possible, and challenging us to improve the release process.

### Project Velocity

<CHECKOUT THE DEVSTATS AND HIGHLIGHT SOME INTRESTING NUMBERS https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/12/dashboards?orgId=1&refresh=15m, INCLUDE ANY INTERESTED DATA YOU FIND FOR THE CYCLE>

The CNCF K8s [DevStats](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/11/companies-contributing-in-repository-groups?orgId=1&var-period=m&var-repogroup_name=All) project aggregates a number of interesting data points related to the velocity of Kubernetes and various sub-projects. 
This includes everything from individual contributions to the number of companies that are contributing and is an illustration of the depth and breadth of effort that goes into evolving this ecosystem.

In the v1.XX release cycle, which ran for X weeks (START DATE to RELEASE DATE), we saw contributions to Kubernetes from X different companies and X individuals.

Source for this data: 
- [Companies contributing to Kubernetes](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/11/companies-contributing-in-repository-groups?orgId=1&from=1715032800000&to=1723586399000&var-period=d28&var-repogroup_name=Kubernetes&var-repo_name=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes)
- [Overall ecosystem contributions](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/11/companies-contributing-in-repository-groups?orgId=1&from=1715032800000&to=1723586399000&var-period=d28&var-repogroup_name=All&var-repo_name=kubernetes%2Fkubernetes)

By contribution we mean when someone makes a commit, code review, comment, creates an issue or PR, reviews a PR (including blogs and documentation) or comments on issues and PRs.

If you are interested in contributing see our [getting started](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/#getting-started) page.
