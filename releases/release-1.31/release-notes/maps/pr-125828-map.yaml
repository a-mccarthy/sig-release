  text: Promoted CRI communication of the cgroup driver mechanism to beta.
    The `KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI` feature gate is now in beta and enabled by default.
    This allows the kubelet to query the container runtime using CRI to determine the
    mechanism for cgroup management. If the container runtime doesn't support this, the
    kubelet falls back to using the configuration file (you can also use the deprecated
    `--cgroup-driver` command line argument).
